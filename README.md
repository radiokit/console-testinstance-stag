# RadioKit Console

User interface for controlling various RadioKit systems

# Branch management

Console is being developed with Git Flow approach. You can read about it more on [nvie.com](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

To allow JIRA to track repository changes - it is encouraged to name feature branches or single commits with a name of JIRA task.

`Master` branch always contains production-ready version, `develop` is for staging environment.
